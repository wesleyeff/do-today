# Do Today

Do Today is a daily to do list that I built in response to the covvid-19 global pandemic.

It is a list of daily tasks that one might otherwise forget to do when there is so much other noise going on. The list clears automatically every night so you start with a clean slate every day.

It's build to run as a PWA on your phone so you remember to check it every day.

You can access it [here](https://apps.wesleyf.net/todo).

## Technology

I build this using react and hooks. I tried out a few ways to style it, bootstrap, styled components. I ended up settling on TailwindCSS.

I'm working on a branch to convert it to typescript
